# CrossFit Competition Winner Prediction
## CrossFit_Data_Science_Project


## Features

- Scrape participant data from the CrossFit Games website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup
- Collect information such as names, scores, age, country, height, weight, and event performance
- Identify winners of the CrossFit Games and label them in the dataset
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for winner prediction
- Display the accuracy of the models

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:

## Information

This project utilizes Python and the following libraries:
- Selenium: For web scraping
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: For numerical computations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning models

The project scrapes data from the CrossFit Games website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
It collects participant information and event performance data.
Machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Elastic Net are used to predict the winners based on the collected data.
